# 🌊 Ghost Net Detector – BrainChain Project

A smart, solar-powered floating marine device designed to **detect ghost fishing nets** and monitor **real-time water quality** using sensors. This project combines **hardware simulation (Wokwi)** and a **web-based dashboard** to provide actionable alerts for coast guards and marine conservation teams.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
create an wed where fisherman report plastic sightings or water quality issues, crowdsourcing pollution monitoring.


**Goal:** To develop a smart, low-cost, solar-powered marine monitoring device that automatically detects ghost nets and monitors pollution parameters like pH, turbidity, and TDS — providing real-time alerts and location tracking.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup Instructions





## ▶️ How to Run the Project

---

### 🧪 A. Hardware Simulation (Wokwi)

1. Go to the Wokwi simulation link:  
   🔗 [Run Device Simulation](https://wokwi.com/projects/436428149476432897)

2. Press the **Play ▶️ button** to start the simulation.

3. Monitor the **Serial Output Console** for:
   - Water quality readings (pH, TDS, Turbidity)
   - Ghost net detection alerts based on simulated sensor data

4. You can tweak sensor values in the code or UI to simulate different conditions (like dirty water or metallic nets).

### 🌐 B. Web App

The web interface is under development. Once live, the flow will be:

1. Open the web app in your browser
2. Log in using your credentials
3. View:
   - **Live water quality data**
   - **Ghost net detection alerts**
   - **Real-time map showing device location**

🔗 Web App Link:

### 🛠️ Developer Testing 


1. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code
2. Right-click `index.html` → “Open with Live Server” *(or open it manually in any browser)*
3. Navigate to `dashboard.html` or `map.html` using the links
